PintOS is used as the main programming and implementation focus for the UT course CS439 Principles of Computer Systems. Throughout the semester we work at a team of 4 people to implement each part of the basic operating system. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system. The base code of the PintOS operating system is very simple, but for our projects we strengthen them to allow multithreading, synchronization / avoiding deadlock, and a proper scheduling system. \r\nFor academic purposes, we run PintOS in a system simulator; a program that simulates the 80x86 CPU accurately. It uses the Bochs and QEMU simulators; on a side note, PintOS has also been tested with VMware Player.\r\n\r\n## Project 1 - Threads\r\n\r\nGiven a minimally functional thread system, we extend the functionality to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems. The main source code is under the \"threads\" directory and some work done in the \"devices\" directory. Compilation is done in the \"threads\" directory. Things covered in this project during the implementation are: thread creation and completion, scheduler to switch between threads, and synchronization primitives (semaphores, locks, condition variables, and optimization barriers.)\r\n\r\n## Project 2 - User Programs\r\n\r\nIn this project, we work and implement the parts of the system that allow the user to run programs. The base code already supports loading and running user programs, but no I/O or interactivity is possible. For this project, we worked as a team to enable program to interact with the OS via system calls. Most of the work was done in the \"userprog\" directory, but other directories were modified as well. This project is built on top of project 1. As with real world projects with companies, this project must meet the specification of a working OS. \r\n\r\n## Project 3 - Virtual Memory\r\n\r\nIn this project, after we have familiarized ourselves with the inner workings of PintOS, we implement virtual memory. We can properly handle multiple threads of execution with proper synchronization and can load multiple user programs at once. However, the number and size of programs is limited by the machine's main memory size. As a team, we work to remove that limitation. Most of the work was done in the \"vm\" directory.\r\n\r\n## Project 4 - File Systems\r\n\r\nNow, we have a mostly working PintOS operating system but we need to implement and improve the file system. We implement the buffer cache and integrate it into the exiting file system, and allow extensible files and subdirectories. We must also pass persistence tests. Most of the work was done in the \"filesys\" directory.\r\n\r\n## Overall Impression\r\n\r\nThough this class was by the hardest class I've taken at UT, it was well worth it. In fact, I've opted to not sell the textbook because it was such a great reference (Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective). After many hours  upon days upon weeks, me and my group managed to finish all projects with an average score of 87% and I scored a total final grade of a B which is well above average for this course at UT.
